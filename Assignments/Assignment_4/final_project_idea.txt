Who is the King of Attacks? Shark, Alligator, or Wolves

Final Project Idea: Examine predatory attacks of sharks, alligators, and wolves data. 
Create graphs that show where the attacks were located and explore if there is an age group most affected. 

1. Download csv files from kaggle.com will be used for graphing the data along with additional research.
First, download the data from kagglehub:(shark attacks) attacks.csv, list_coor_australia.csv, 
fatal_alligator_attacks_US.csv, shark_attacks.csv (another shark attack file), and gloal_wolves.csv.
If more information is needed, download other information. 

2. Examine Shark Attack(s), Fatal Gator Attack, and Global Wolf Attack files.
Compare the locations, months, and age ranges. 

3. Create graphs that show the different years and location of Attacks to 
determine the "king" of attacking and if the attacks were provoked or not. 
Also, examine if there is a certain month that has more attacks.
