# 1. Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.

Yes, some predicted values may be considered scientifically meaningless if they fall outside a specific variable range. For example, if the predicted GrowthRate is either negative, exceedingly high, or if a prediction is far from the observed data, then this may potentially indicate that the model is not generalizing well.



# 2. In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? Do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.

Yes, in some plots like GrowthRate vs. Nitrogen, there might be non-linear relationships. Non-linear relationships can often be modeled using techniques like polynomial regression or Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). A good resource I found was found on GitHub. The individual did a good job of simplifying the information in steps. <https://tuos-bio-data-skills.github.io/intro-stats-book/non-linear-regression-in-R.html>



# 3. Write the code you would use to model the data found in “/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv” with a linear model (there are a few ways of doing this)

# Load data
non_linear_data <- read.csv("Data/non_linear_relationship.csv")

# Visualize the data
non_linear_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = predictor, y = response)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Non-linear Data")

# Fit polynomial linear model (quadratic)
mod_poly <- lm(response ~ poly(predictor, 2), data = non_linear_data)
summary(mod_poly)

# Visualize fit poly
non_linear_data %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = predictor, y = response)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), color = "blue", se = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal()
